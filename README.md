# HS-Analyzer
Official repository for the HS Analyzer project

## HS-Analyzer ended its operation by transferring the Helium project to Solana, and thus changing the way the API works.

### Thank you to everyone who used my project, especially @mhgdn, @crey, @m2c and @keygen from Helium Polska Discord who helped develop the project and everyone who donated the project.

#### The tool was created as a side project, and the number of users definitely exceeded my expectations ;)

##### I must admit that the code of the project is quite ugly and written quickly, but if anyone would like to use it, the code is here :)
